    As per the LLM's investigation, it flagged these two identical transactions made on the same date from the same vendor with identical items as potential fraudulent activity. This suspicion comes from the unusual pattern of two exactly the same transactions in a short time frame. The system recommends reaching out to the respective authority / person to ascertain the legitimacy of these transactions or conduct a further detailed investigation.[00m
